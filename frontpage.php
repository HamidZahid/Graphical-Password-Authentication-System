        This is a web based authentication system which allows users to sign
        up and log in using a different model.People usually remember pictures
        better than words and text passwords are very easy to hack. Therefore,
        graphical passwords provide better security than traditional text
        passwords. This system combines graphical and text passwords achieving
        the best of both. A user can select images and their grid points and
        use them as the graphical password. Graphical passwords provide a
        promising alternative to traditional alphanumeric passwords. They are
        attractive since people usually remember pictures better than words.
        In this website, we propose a graphical password authentication
        system.
